# HTTP From Scratch in Go

This project aims to build a basic HTTP server from scratch using Go, without relying on the standard `net/http` package for core HTTP handling.

## Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol
- Implement HTTP parsing and response logic manually
- Learn about TCP networking in Go

## Resources Used

- [RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)
- [Go net package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/net)
- [Build Your Own HTTP Server in Go](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/building-a-simple-http-server-in-go/)
- [HTTP Made Really Easy](https://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/)
- [Socket programming in Go](https://gobyexample.com/tcp-server)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `go run main.go`
3. Connect via browser or `curl` to test
